*****Question 1: What’s difference between Portable (CPL) and Shared (SAP) projects ?************

 CPL = 
 It is used to create a class library that targets multiple platforms 
 (especially Silverlight variants like WP7 and SL4, but includes XNA on Xbox) in one go.
  
  SAP =

We can import data from an SAP system into a SQL Server database. This section provides instructions
on how to create an SSIS package that you can run to import data.

*****Question 2:  What are the requirements to configure Xamarin Mac Agent?*******

Requirements

Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio accomplishes an amazing feat: it lets developers create, 
build, and debug iOS applications on a Windows computer using the Visual Studio IDE. 
It cannot do this alone – iOS applications cannot be created without Apple’s compiler, 
and they cannot be deployed without Apple’s certificates and code-signing tools. This means that 
your Xamarin.iOS for Visual Studio installation requires a connection to a networked Mac OS X computer 
(which is refered to as the host or build host) to perform these tasks for you. Once configured, Xamarin’s 
tools will make the process as seamless as possible.

System Requirements
The system requirements are:
Windows
Windows 7 or higher.
Visual Studio 2013 Professional or higher.
Xamarin for Visual Studio. 
NOTE: The Xamarin plug-in cannot be used with Express editions of Visual Studio due to lack of support for extensions.
Macintosh
A Mac running OS X El Capitan (10.11) or higher (although the latest stable version is recommended).
Xamarin Studio 5.10 or higher (although the latest stable version is recommended)). 
This should be on the same distribution channel as Xamarin for Visual Studio.
Xamarin.iOS SDK.
Apple’s Xcode(7+) IDE and iOS SDK (although the latest stable version from the App Store is recommended)).

*****Question 3: How many projects you have and why you need all?***********

each of them has what it takes to be able to compile in each one of the platforms
